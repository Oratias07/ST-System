## 🧐 About the Project

The **AI Code Grader** is designed to streamline the grading process for programming instructors. Instead of manually debugging every line of student code, this tool uses advanced AI to analyze submissions against a master solution and a defined rubric.

It generates a **numerical score (0-10)** and detailed, constructive **feedback in Hebrew**, allowing teachers to focus on teaching rather than grading mechanics.
