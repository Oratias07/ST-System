# 📖 Instructor User Guide

Welcome to the AI Code Grader! This guide will help you navigate the system and maximize your grading efficiency.

## 1. Getting Started
1.  **Login**: Click "Continue with Google" on the home screen. You must use your authorized faculty email.
2.  **Session Security**: For security, your session expires after **2 hours** of inactivity. You will be asked to re-authenticate if this limit is reached.

## 2. Setting Up an Exercise
Before grading, you must define the "Gold Standard" for the assignment:
- **Question**: Paste the exact instructions given to students.
- **Master Solution**: Provide a perfect implementation of the code.
- **Rubric**: Define the points allocation and specific things to look for.
- **Custom Instructions**: (Optional) Add specific bans like "No use of pointers" or "Must use do-while".

## 3. The Grading Workflow
1.  **Select Student**: Choose the student name from the dropdown.
2.  **Paste Code**: Go to the **Student Code** tab and paste the submission.
3.  **Evaluate**: Click the ✨ **Evaluate & Save** button.
4.  **Review**: Check the Hebrew feedback and score. The system automatically saves this to the database and selects the next student in the list for you.

## 4. Class Management (Sheets View)
Switch to the **Sheets** tab to see your entire class in a grid:
- **Bulk View**: See scores and feedback for all students across all exercises.
- **Manual Overrides**: You can manually click any score or feedback cell to edit it.
- **Exporting**: Click **Download CSV** to get an Excel-ready file with correct Hebrew encoding.

## 5. Using the AI Assistant
If you are struggling to write a rubric or want to know why a student's code is failing, click the blue floating chat icon in the bottom right. The **Grading Assistant** knows the context of your current session and can help you troubleshoot.
